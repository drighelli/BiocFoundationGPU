## BiocFoundationGPU

This package allows deploying a set of pre-defined foundation models for various tasks in R. 
It provides an interface to easily access and utilize these models using: 

* `basilisk` (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/basilisk.html) 
* `reticulate` (https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)

and for tasks such as generating embeddings of spatial or imaging datasets.

The package is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it accessible to both 
beginners and experienced users in the field of machine learning and deep learning. 

Both `basilisk` and `reticulate` are used to manage Python dependencies and provide a 
seamless interface between R and Python. However, for foundation models that are 
deployed with `reticulate` only (e.g. KRONOS), example scripts for building and running 
environments can be found under `inst/scripts/venv_builds`.

Currently there are environments for the following models:

* scGPT (https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT)
* Novae (https://github.com/prism-oncology/novae)
* KRONOS (https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS)
